# Countdown Screensaver Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully transformed your Countdown Wallpaper app to also function as a macOS screensaver. The implementation maintains separate screensaver files alongside your main project while sharing the same timer data and visual appearance.

## What Was Created

### 1. Screensaver Bundle Structure
- **Location**: `Screensaver/` directory
- **Bundle**: `CountdownScreensaver.saver`
- Contains all necessary files for a macOS screensaver

### 2. Key Files Created

#### Screensaver Code
- `Screensaver/CountdownScreensaverView.swift` - Main screensaver implementation
- `Screensaver/SharedModels.swift` - Shared data models (Timer, Template, Layout)
- `Screensaver/Info.plist` - Screensaver bundle configuration

#### Build System
- `Screensaver/Makefile` - Build and installation commands
- `Screensaver/build.sh` - Convenience build script
- `Screensaver/README.md` - Documentation for building and installing

### 3. Main App Updates

#### Shared Data Storage
- Updated `CountdownTimer.swift` to use shared UserDefaults suite (`com.countdownwallpaper.app`)
- Both wallpaper and screensaver read from the same timer data

#### Settings Integration
- Added screensaver controls in `SettingsView.swift`
- "Open Screensaver Preferences" button
- Shows installation status
- Instructions for installation if not installed

#### URL Scheme Support
- Added URL scheme handler in `CountdownWallpaperApp.swift`
- Updated `Info.plist` with `countdownwallpaper://` URL scheme
- Configure button in screensaver opens main app settings

## How It Works

1. **Shared Timer Data**: The screensaver reads timer data from the same UserDefaults suite as the wallpaper app
2. **Visual Consistency**: Uses the same layout engine and display styles as the wallpaper
3. **Black Background**: Screensaver has a solid black background instead of transparent
4. **Multi-Screen Support**: Screensaver properly supports multiple displays
5. **Live Updates**: Timers update every second, just like the wallpaper

## Installation Instructions

1. **Build the Screensaver**:
   ```bash
   cd Screensaver
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. **Install for Current User**:
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

3. **Test the Installation**:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

This opens System Preferences to the Screen Saver pane where you can select "Countdown Screensaver"

## Features Implemented

✅ Displays same timers as wallpaper
✅ Solid black background
✅ Updates every second
✅ Multiple screen support
✅ Configure button opens main app
✅ Shared settings between wallpaper and screensaver
✅ Installation status in main app settings
✅ Simple screensaver files separate from main project

## Usage

1. Configure timers in the Countdown Wallpaper app
2. The screensaver automatically uses the same timers
3. Click "Screen Saver Options..." in System Preferences to open the main app
4. All timer changes are reflected in both wallpaper and screensaver

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Uses macOS ScreenSaver framework
- **UI**: SwiftUI-based interface embedded in ScreenSaverView
- **Data Sharing**: UserDefaults suite ensures data consistency
- **Architecture**: Modular design keeps screensaver code separate from main app

The implementation provides a seamless experience where users manage one set of timers that appear in both their wallpaper and screensaver.
